# Leaflet Challenge

## Leaflet-Step-1

![1-Basic Map](Images/1-Logo.png)

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!


### Geo-JSON

![2-USGS API](Images/Geo_JSON.png)

This API is for the last 7 days earthquake data located here [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) .

1. **Criteria 1**

   ![3-Data](Images/3-Data.png)

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.

### Level 2: More Data (Optional)

![5-Advanced](Images/5-Advanced.png)

The USGS wants you to plot a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. You will need to pull in a second data set and visualize it along side your original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

In this step we are going to..

* Plot a second data set on our map.

* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to our map.

### Assessment

Your final product will be assessed on the following metrics:

* Completion of assigned tasks

* Visual appearance

* Professionalism

* Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file

**Good luck!**
